Github:
git clone (insert http location) - Copy repository and make folder called by it's name
git status - see what's different (added) between your local repository and online repository
git add - add a file to be sent to the online repository
git add -A - adds all files
git commit -m "(insert quote)" - prepares for commit *if you forget to type -m, press: esc :wq (one at a time)*
git push - push it to the repository

If you want to make another branch and treat you own branch like a master:

/* ... */  <----- where you type file, create, or note

git checkout -b /*some branch*/
git status /* checks the branch your currently on */
