Github:
git clone (insert http location) - Copy repository and make folder called by it's name
git status - see what's different (added) between your local repository and online repository
git add - add a file to be sent to the online repository
git add -A - adds all files
git commit -m "(insert quote)" - prepares for commit *if you forget to type -m, press: esc :wq (one at a time)*
git push - push it to the repository
git pull - get all updates from everyone to your local repository



Lynn's Notes:
If you want to make another branch and treat you own branch like a master.  Create another branch ontop of current branch.

/* ... */  <----- FYI, where you type file, create, or note

git checkout -b   /*some branch*/
git status   /* checks the branch your currently on */

/* make changes in your project */

git add -all   /* adds all files that were created or fixed */
git commit -m   " /* leave a comment */ "
git push origin  /* type branch currently on */
